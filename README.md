# Telegram bot
Telegram bot written by developer who learned Java
# Idea 
The main idea is to create the first application to improve your programming skills in Java and beyond.
#MVP Scope
As a user, I want to subscribe on group of posts and get notification via telegram-bot every time, when new post, related to group subscriptions, has come.
#How it works
Based on MVP Scope, we can specify next behaviours (here and after Telegram User, which is using JavaRush Telgegram bot will call User):
<ul>
<li>User can subscribe on group of posts</li>
<li>User can view list of group subscriptions on which user subscribes</li>
<li>User can unsubscribe from group of posts</li>
<li>User can set an inactive bot and do not receive notifications</li>
<li>User can restart getting notifications</li>
</ul>
